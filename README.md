# Beginner Programmer's Toolkit
A set of programming tools for beginners

## Download
###### Includes three built-in languages and a text editor
[Self-extracting 7zip-exe or 7zip archive](https://github.com/adabo/Beginner_Programmer-s_Toolkit/releases)

## Installation
1. Move the self-extracting executable to a convenient folder in which you would like to work in (e.g. C:\\Users\\\*UserName\*\\Desktop or USB Flash drive)
2. Run the exe.
3. A new folder named "Programming-Toolkit" will be available.
4. Open the folder and verify that the contents are there.

## Usage
Run "start\_toolkit.bat" from the main folder. Begin writing code in one of the three built in languages,

- AutoHotkey
- Python
- C++

Then save your code to the same folder as the "start\_toolkit.bat" file. From the menu bar open "Tools" and click "Go". SciTE will attempt to run (or first compile if C++) the code. A new output pane will open on the right side. All input/output information will be displayed in the output pane.

- If your code requires user input you must type directly in the output pane at the end of or below the last line.




Press enter to continue execution of your program.

*There is a limitation when typing input that backspace will be ignored in the final output. For example, when your program asks for input and you type: "My fisrt program." But you pressed backspace twice to correct the typo, the final output will be "My fisrst program".
